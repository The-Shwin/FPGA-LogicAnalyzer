# FPGA-LogicAnalyzer
An implementation of a logic analyzer for a Spartan 6 FPGA.

This logic analyzer is part of a larger implementation done for a course. The entire implementation also modules that have a slowed down sampling rate and different numbers of channels. This file is for a logic analyzer implementation where the FPGA input clock is multiplied so that higher frequency signals can be properly sampled by the FPGA.
